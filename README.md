## File Structure and Organization
The beginning of the project structure begins with the "app" folder. This folder is the skeleton of the entire application.
From the app folder, other sections of the project can be accessed, such as the Manifest folder, the Resources folder, and the main 
project folder for the application.

By following the file path app->java you can access the main java files/classes for the project. The "res" folder contains all interface
layout files, icons and background images for the design of the application.

From the "gradle" folder, you can access all gradle files from which you can add and edit dependencies.
